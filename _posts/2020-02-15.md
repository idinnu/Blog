## Start of my blog

Woah! This feels nice. I will be mostly be posting on Finance, Probability and Statistics,Football and maybe Music. Target of this year is to publish 12 blog posts until the end of the year. So there's a lot of work to do and hopefully you will enjoy reading them. 

The purpose of this blog is to help myself learn new things while explaining what I have learnt and what I haven't in the simplest way possible.

This is my [twitter link](https://twitter.com/Indraneeldesh) , where I mostly retweet ideas and thoughts which I find interesting.
